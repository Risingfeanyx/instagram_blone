#The purpose of this function is twofold; you tell it a filename and descriptor, and it will create a new html page headed with your image, descriptor, and insert a link to the page into your index.html page, so instead  of writing a whole new page in your text editor of choice, you'd run newpage $image.fileformat $descriptor, 
and let it do the rest. 

#newpage imagefile.extension "Description".
